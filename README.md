# a simple ssh_config parser

now I have so many entries in my ~/.ssh/config and like to make easy to find one.
this is a simple solution. this cli app returns the entry as JSON.
```
Usage:
  sshconfig alias
```

for example like that:
```
‚ùØ sshconfig myhost
{
  Host: "myhost",
  HostName: "xxx.xx.xx.x",
  Port: "2222",
  User: "me",
  IdentityFile: "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```
